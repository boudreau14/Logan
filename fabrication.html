                                Because of its accuracy most parts can be finished on the laser saving time and additional machining cost. Logan 
                                Machine also utilizes CAD software for nesting and complex shapes making the most out every sheet of material. With

                                and silver solder. We have the ability to handle weldments of many types in aluminum, hot and cold finish, or 
                                stainless steel. Logan's experienced welders are skilled and can weld 0.5" fillets in one pass, enabling us to
                                 be very cost effective. Unlike many other welding shops, at Logan we hire only qualified welders and fitters. 
                                 This ensures the consistency and precision our customer require. And because we have a machining “frame of mind”,
                                  you can depend on Logan people to pay close attention to dimensions and other details, no matter how small. This

                                cabinets. Since most guards are built during final assembly, this department works closely with our assembly operation.
                                 Like all Logan departments, our sheet metal facility has a level of versatility that can accommodate any customer 
                                 order with speed and precision, which are the true hallmarks of a Logan job.
